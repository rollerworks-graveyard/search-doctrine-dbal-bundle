RollerworksSearchDoctrineDbalBundle
===================================

Main purpose of this bundle is to integrate the [RollerworksSearch Doctrine DBAL extension][1]
with any Symfony based application.

    RollerworksSearch provides a powerful searching system.

Installation
------------

This package is an extension for the [RollerworksSearchBundle][2]
make sure you have successfully installed and configured the bundle before continuing.

Require the rollerworks/search-doctrine-dbal-bundle package in your composer.json
and update your dependencies.

```bash
$ composer require rollerworks/search-doctrine-dbal-bundle
```

Add the RollerworksSearchDoctrineDbalBundle to your application's kernel:

```php
// in AppKernel::registerBundles()
$bundles = [
    // ...
    new Rollerworks\Bundle\SearchBundle\RollerworksSearchBundle(),
    new Rollerworks\Bundle\SearchDoctrineDbalBundle\RollerworksSearchDoctrineDbalBundle(),
];
```

Configuration
-------------

The RollerworksSearchDoctrineDbalBundle is already pre-configured and does not require
configuring. But you properly want to configure a 'real' cache which stays persistent
between page requests.

### Caching

The Caching system uses the doctrine/cache system for caching generated SQL/DQL queries.
You can use any driver supported by Doctrine for caching.

**Note:** The default driver uses an array which is only cached in memory.

Use a service-id as value for `rollerworks_search_doctrine_dbal.cache_driver`.

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
rollerworks_search_doctrine_dbal:
    cache_driver: rollerworks_search.doctrine_dbal.cache.array_driver
```

Usage
-----

The `rollerworks_search.doctrine_dbal.factory` service provides the
`Rollerworks\Component\Search\Doctrine\Dbal\DoctrineDbalFactory` for creating WhereBuilders.
